Selector, to test the selector's part of CSS

To Compile:
    make all

In order to get installed, you will need:
    - wxhaskell
    - uulib
    - uuagc
    - uuparsinglib (not necessary for executing but for generating selectors examples)

Then you can execute with:  ./sel

There are some html examples that you can try (I am using just some html tags).
